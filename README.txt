The Code is stored as .ino files, but the practices are all Bare Metal, allowing for them to be run as .c files

There is a report associated with the Labs and Mid Term going into detail what the code is designed to do

Lab 1: Introduction to Bare Metal (Blinking Lights)
Lab 2: Introduction to Communication Protocols (UART, I2C, SPI)

Mid Term: Focuses on PWM and its various Applications (Intervals, Motors)

Project: Links sensor data to a WebApp, which also enables remote watering (Manual + Scheduled) Awarded best in the class
