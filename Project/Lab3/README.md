# Lab 3

## Tasks:

1. Write a bash script that blinks an LED using the BeagleBone.
2. Write a program using Python or C that blinks an LED using the BeagleBone.

3. Bonus: Using SPI with the Arduino Nano.

You must consult with the teaching staff before attempting this bonus as a level shifter is required for MOSI, MISO, SS and SCLK.
This is because the BeagleBone operates on 3.3V digital logic and the Nanos on 5V.

- Write a program for Arduino Nano that will send a message through SPI when a GPIO pin is pulled low.
- Write a program using a language of your choice that will in turn toggle an LED that is connected to the BeagleBone when it receives a certain signal.

## Deliverables

Students are expected to create a `.zip` file that they will upload to Moodle for grading. The following is expected in the archive:

- A folder containing your source code
- A report in **.PDF** format, no other formats will be accepted.

The document is expected to contain the following and **one submission per group**:

0. List team members on cover page of report.
1. An introduction containing a problem statement, as well as abbreviations and acronyms used.
2. Physical resources used to complete the lab: This includes hardware componenets used and how they may be configured.
3. Software resources used to complete the lab: This section details anysoftware used including IDEs, compilers, loaders, specific configurations
and procedures needed to complete the labs.
4. Program snippets: This section contains snippets from your code related to each section.
5. Reference Code Common: Discuss all the libraries used in your code and explain briefly how and why they were used.
6. Discussion and Conclusion.
